Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete the same.

2. MUST go through "day1-data\day1_help\day1_sequence.rtf" and  from day1-data\day1_help\ & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf
(only till whatever  we have covered)

3. Go through  code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve (Hands on)

4.1 Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.
OR 
Create java application for the following
Accept 2 numbers from user & operation to perform
1. Add 2.Subtract 3. Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
Display the result of the operation. 
Java app must continue to run till user chooses exit option.


Day 2

1. MUST revise from today's sequence ("day2-data\day2_help\day2-sequence.rtf") n
refer : day2-data\code
1.1 Revise :  mem pics for Java data areas(stack,heap,method area),
1.2 Garbage collection introduction

1.3 refer : day1-data\day1_help\diagrams\different type of vars.png


1.4 
 Solve this (Discuss memory picture)
Given : Box class is compiled.
In main method  of TestBox
Box b1=new Box(1,2,3);
b1++;
Box b2=b1;
b1=new Box(3,4,5);
//any objects marked for garbage collection ? how many ? 
Box b3=b1;
b2=new Box(4,5,6);
//any objects marked for garbage collection ? how many ?


2. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}
Are there any objects marked for GC ?

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing1.java

4. Hands on
(Currently place all the classes in the default un named package)

Create a  class Point2D   for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords
eg : public String show() {.....}

4.3 
Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

How will you invoke it from the tester 
A Hint :  p1.isEqual(p2); 
OR
p2.isEqual(p1)

4.4 
Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

eg : In Tester :
double distance=p1.calculateDistance(p2);

4.5  Create a separate Driver(main)  class(for UI )  , "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the co-ordinates
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
4.8  (Optional work)
Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.



Day 3
1. Download and extract Eclipse IDE with Spring (STS - Spring tool Suite)
Refer - "day1-data\day1_help\Installation instructions for JDK n IDE.txt"

2. Refer to today's sequence - 
"day3-data\day3_help\day3-sequence.rtf"

3. Refer to  <day3.1> , to revise 
access specifiers , packages n classpath 

4. Modify yesterday's Point2D's assignment (This has to be done w/o IDE)
Re factor (modify) n add Point2D class under the package - com.developers.geometry
Add TestPoint class under the package - com.tester
Make necessary changes .
Ensure that user should be able to run com.tester.TestPoint class from anywhere.
Hint - set CLASSPATH


5. Start the IDE (STS 3.9.18 : Eclipse IDE with Spring plug in)
Create a new workspace for core java.
Import day3.2 , in your workspace
Revise : arrays of primitive type n array of references
for-each loop
for vs for-each loop

6. 
 Discuss - 
== vs isEqual
using Point2D scenario

7. More hands on (Continue in IDE)
(OPTIONAL)

7.1   Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

1. Prompt user , how many points to plot? 
Create suitable array. (Hint : array of references)

2. Show following options

Options : 
1. Plot a point
Inputs : array index , x  ,y
Check boundary conditions  n also check if some point is already plotted at the same index , if not then store the point details.
In case of any errors , display suitable error message.

2.   Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.

0. Exit 

Day 4

1. NO new solving assignments !

2. Complete pending work
(Point2d array based assignment)

3. import day4.1 eclipse project , to revise static keyword

4. import day4.2 eclipse project , to revise inheritance n run time polymorphism.
Very important to revise !

5. For those , who have completed earlier work , try guessing the o/p
day4-data\params_passing - TestParamPassing3.java , TestParamPassing4.java

Day 5

1. Answer this popular question 
How does this auto invoke ref.toString() ?
System.out.prinln(ref); 
Clue - java docs

2. Before completing the pending work , revise first.
2.1 import day5.1 to revise
inheritance , constructor invocation , upcasting , downcasting , instanceof checking , ClassCastException.

2.2 import day5.2 , to refer to bounded shapes hierarchy

2.3 Must go through 
today's sequence n readme "regarding instanceof"

3. Solve (Mandatory assignment)
Read complete assignment n then only solve.

1.1 Can you arrange Fruit,Apple,Orange,Mango in inheritance hierarchy ?
Use tight encapsulation.

1.2 Properties (instance variables)  in Fruit class-
 color : String , weight : double , name:String, isFresh : boolean

1.3 Add suitable constructor

1.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  - name ,color , weight )

1.5 Add a taste() method : public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ? NO
So add a taste() with this definition : returns "no specific taste" 

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

1.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}
In Apple : public void jam() {Display name of the fruit + a mesg  making jam!}

1.7 Add all of above classes under the package "com.app.fruits"
1.8 Create java application FruitBasket , with main method , as a tester
1.9 Prompt user for the basket size n create suitable data structure

1.10 Supply options
1. Add Mango
2. Add Orange
3. Add Apple
NOTE : You will be ALWAYS adding a fresh fruit in the basket , in all of above options.

1. Display names of all fruits in the basket.

5. Display name,color,weight , taste of all fresh fruits , in the basket.


6. Invoke fruit specific functionality (pulp / juice / jam)
i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

0. Exit
